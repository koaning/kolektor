This repository contains some minor scrapers inspired by [this blogpost by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/). It's a variant though. These scrapers will scrape once a day and the goal is to have the entire dataset hosted on github. The idea is that the hosted data can also serve as a backend that way!
